# Hi there, Iâ€™m Roger!

I'm a former Seattlite living in Osaka, Japan. In 2022, I made a transition into software development driven by my desire to create and my passion for learning new things. I spent ten years as an English teacher in Japan, gaining valuable cross-cultural communication skills. During the Covid pandemic, I attended the Advanced Software Engineering in Python program at Code Fellows in Seattle.  There,  I gained proficiency in crafting innovative applications using an diverse array of technologies including JavaScript, NextJs, Tailwind, and Python. 

My journey in software development continues as I deepen my expertise in machine learning and data analysis with Python. Additionally, I am expanding my skill set by mastering the suite of tools offered by AWS.
