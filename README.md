# Hi there, Iâ€™m Roger!

With a background in education and the medical field, I made a transition into software development driven by my passion for creating practical solutions. After spending ten years as an English teacher in Japan and gaining valuable cross-cultural communication skills, I pivoted into software, where I enjoy writing creative apps using a variety of tools, especially Python. While I'm building my knowledge in machine learning and data, my focus remains on developing user-friendly tools. I thrive on continuous learning and embrace opportunities to grow my skills in the dynamic tech industry.

- MinorTron
  - A chatbot built using Django and the OpenAI GPT-3 API to allow users to chat with a helpful assistant. The bot can answer questions, tell jokes, help the user find a recipe, and more. Django authentication allows user chats to persist, being stored in a Sqlite database.
  - [Repo](https://github.com/rsw359/djangobot/tree/main/d_chatbot)
- Iro Iro
  - A colorizer app built using React and the OpenCV model to allow users to add color to black and white photos uploaded from their PC. The backend is built on FastAPI, with Images being stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
